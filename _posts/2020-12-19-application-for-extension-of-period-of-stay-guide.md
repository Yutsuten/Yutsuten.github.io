Recently I've been through the process to extend my VISA here in Japan.
It can be a pretty smooth process if you know how it is,
*but* exhaustive if you don't.

While I was doing my extension,
I wish there were a Senpai that could guide me through the process.
Unfortunately, there weren't.
And I had some problems.
(To be more exact, the problem was in the documents my company issued.
So there is a chance that the person in charge at your company don't know the necessary documents.)

Here I'll share with you my experience,
and will be especially focused on the needed documents.
I hope you have a smooth extension process!

## Necessary documents

### 1) Application for Extension of Period of Stay

[Download](http://www.moj.go.jp/content/001290202.pdf)

#### Applicant

You can fill this application at the Immigration Office.
If you want to fill it beforehand,
you will need to fill the following pages of the PDF:

- **Page 1:** For applicant, part 1
- **Page 3:** For applicant, part 2

#### Organization

It is necessary for the company to fill and stamp its seal beforehand.
Be sure to have this before going there.

- **Page 4:** For organization, part 1
- **Page 5:** For organization, part 2
- **Page 7:** For organization, part 4

Even if the company doesn't fill page 6,
it is needed to print and submit it, so be careful.

### 2) Photo

3x4 cm, it will be attached to the application and submitted.
It is possible to attach (glue) at the Immigration Office.

### 3) Passport and Residence Card

### 4) Withholding tax slip of the last year

In Japanese:

- Kyuuyo Shotoku no Gensen Choushuuhyou - きゅうよ しょとく の げんせん ちょうしゅうひょう

You receive this document once every year from the company.

Seems that the company’s stamp is needed.
Be on the safe side and ask for the stamp beforehand.
Submit the document’s copy.

### 5) Tax payment certificate

There are two certificates you need:

- Jyuuminzei no Kazei Shoumeisho - じゅうみんぜい の かぜい しょうめいしょ
- Nouzei Shoumeisho - のうぜい しょうめいしょ

It must have the latest information, with a period of 1 year.
You may get this document at your City Office. You pay a fee to get it.

### 6) Certificate of employment

Ask the company.
